# Samsung-RISCV

<details>
<summary><b>Task 1 :</b> This Task involves reviewing C-based and RISC-V-based lab videos and performing the compilation of C code using both GCC and the RISC-V compiler</summary>

### C Language based LAB
We need to follow the specified steps to compile any **.c** file on our machine:  
1. Open the bash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your file. Then run the following command:

	```
	gedit sum_1ton.c
	```  
2. This will open the editor, allowing you to write in the file you created. Enter the C code to calculate and print the sum of n numbers. After completing your code, press ```Ctrl + S``` to save your file, and then press ```Ctrl + W``` to close the editor.   
3. To the C code on your terminal, run the following command:

	```
	gcc sum_1ton.c
	./a.out
	```

### RISCV based LAB
We need to compile the code again, but this time using the RISC-V GCC compiler. Follow the steps provided:  
1. Open the terminal and run the given command:  

	```
	cat sum_1ton.c
	```
![cat Command](https://github.com/Amaanbani/Samsung-RISCV/blob/main/Task%201/cat%20Command.png)

2. Using the **cat** command, the entire C code will be displayed on the terminal. Now run the following command to compile the code in riscv64 gcc compiler:  

	```
	riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum_1ton.o sum_1ton.c
	```
3. To execute the C code on your terminal, use the following command.:    

	```
	riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum_1ton.o
	```

4. The Assembly Language code of our C code will be displayed on the terminal. Type ```/main``` to locate the main section of our code.  

### *Descriptions of the keyword used in above command*  
* **-mabi=lp64:** This option specifies the ABI (Application Binary Interface) to use ```lp64```, which is for 64-bit integer, long and pointer size. This ABI is used for 64-bit RISCV architecture.  
* **-march=rv64i:** This option specifies the architecture that we use, which is rv64i, indicates the 64-bit RISCV base integer instruction set. This also confirms the targeting of 64-bit architecture.  
* **riscv-objdump:** A tool for disassembling RISC-V binaries, providing insights into the code structure and helping in debugging.  
* **-Ofast:** The option -Ofast in the command ```riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c``` is a compiler optimization flag used with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). This flag is used to instruct the compiler to optimize the generated code for maximum speed. The use of ```-Ofast``` is typically chosen for applications where execution speed is critical and where deviations from standard behavior are acceptable. However, it's important to test thoroughly, as this level of optimization can introduce subtle bugs, especially in complex calculations or when strict compliance with external standards is required.  
* **-O1:** This options is an optimization level that tells the compiler to optimize the generated code but without greatly increasing compilation time. -O1 aims to reduce code size and execution time while keeping the compilation process relatively quick.  

#### *Other common options are as follows:*  
> 1. **-O0:** No optimization, the default level if no -O option is specified.  
> 2. **-O2:** More aggressive optimizations that might increase compilation time but typically provide faster and sometimes smaller code.  
> 3. **-O3:** Maximizes optimization more aggressively than -O2.  
> 4. **-Os:** Optimizes code for size. It enables all -O2 optimizations that do not typically increase code size.

Here, the term **more aggressive optimization** in the context of compilers like GCC refers to a deeper and more complex set of transformations applied to the code in order to improve its performance and possibly reduce its size. The compiler uses more complex techniques that aims to generate faster executing code or code that occupies less memory. However, these optimizations typically increase the compilation time and can sometimes introduce bugs, making it harder to debug.
